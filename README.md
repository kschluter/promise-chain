# Promise Chain
An example promise pattern for writing asynchronous javascript (in a sequential way) that passes data down the chain or halts execution on error.

# Usage
1. Clone repo
2. Change "const = pass" to "const = fail" in any of the three mod[n].js files to simulate an error/failure in the chain
3. Run start script (npm run start)
